<h1>JavaScript Chapter 1</h1>


<h3>Chapter 1 Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript is used to add behavior to web pages.
<li>Browser engines are much faster at executing JavaScript than they were just a few years ago.</li>
<li>Browsers begin executing JavaScript code as soon as they encounter the code in the page.</li>
<li>Add JavaScript to your page with the < script > element.</li>
<li>You can put your JavaScript inline in the web page, or link to a separate file containing your JavaScript from your HTML. 
<li>Use the src attribute in the < script > tag to link to a separate JavaScript file.</li>
<li>HTML declares the structure and content of your page; JavaScript computes values and adds behavior to your page. 
<li>JavaScript programs are made up of a series of statements. </li>
<li>One of the most common JavaScript statements is a variable declaration, which uses the var keyword to declare a new variable and the assignment operator, =, to assign a value to it.</li>
<li>There are just a few rules and guidelines for naming JavaScript variables, and it’s important that you follow them. </li>
<li>Remember to avoid JavaScript keywords when naming variables. JavaScript expressions compute values. 
<li>Three common types of expressions are numeric, string and boolean expressions.</li>
<li>if/ else statements allow you to make decisions in your code. while/ for statements allow you to execute code many times by looping. /li>
<li>Use console.log instead of alert to display messages to the Console.</li>
<li>Console messages should be used primarily for troubleshooting as users will most likely never see console messages.</li>
<li>JavaScript is most commonly found adding behavior to web pages, but is also used to script applications like Adobe Photoshop, OpenOffice and Google Apps, and is even used as a server-side programming language.</li>
